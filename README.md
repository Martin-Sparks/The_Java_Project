## Wellbeing app


Our wellbeing app is aimed towards individuals who want to track how they were feeling over a set period of time. (16 weeks codeclan)

We will ask basic questions and evaluate on their answers to determine what made their day good/bad and suggest based on their answers, what actions are positive influences and what actions are negative.
